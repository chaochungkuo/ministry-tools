Title: The Intrinsic Significance of Deuteronomy— a Book concerning Christ
Scripture Reading: Deut. 30:11-14; Rom. 10:6-9; Deut. 8:3; Matt. 4:4; Psa. 119:1-2, 9; Deut. 27:1-8
I. Deuteronomy is a concluding word of the law and gives an all-inclusive conclusion to the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible, which were written by Moses:
A. Deuteronomy means “second law” and thus signifies a respeaking, a repeated speaking, of the divine law.
B. The law was given through Moses the first time when he was eighty years old (Exo. 7:7); forty years later, after the first generation, with the exception of Caleb and Joshua, had died out, the law was spoken again to the children of Israel, this time to the second generation, the generation that was ready to enter into the good land and possess it (Deut. 2:14; 8:6-10):
1. If we are going to fully possess Christ as the good land, we must beware of having an evil heart of unbelief—1:25-26, 28, 35-39; 9:23; Heb. 3:12, 16-19; 4:2, 6; 11:1; cf. 2 Cor. 4:13; Gal. 3:2, 5; Rom. 10:17; Acts 6:5a; Num. 13:25-33; 14:4-10; 32:11-12; Josh. 14:6-12.
2. If we are going to fully possess Christ as the good land, we must beware of murmurings (discontented and secret mutterings, grumblings, and complaining)— 1 Cor. 10:5-6, 10-11; Deut. 1:27; Num. 14:1-4; Psa. 106:25; Phil. 2:14.
3. If we are going to fully possess Christ as the good land, we must beware of languishing in the land; the word languish implies the loss of spiritual freshness and the blunting of original impressions, produced by force of custom, or long residence in the same spot—Deut. 4:25; Rev. 3:15-22; Deut. 34:7.
C. Most of the second generation had not been present to hear the giving of the Ten Commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances at Mount Sinai; therefore, God burdened Moses to respeak, to rehearse, the law; this respeaking was a renewed training given to the new generation of the children of Israel after their long wandering, to prepare them to enter into the good land promised by God and inherit it as their possession—Exo. 3:8; Col. 1:12; 2:6-7.
II. The two generations should be interpreted not only in a literal sense but also in a typological sense; the first generation typifies our old man, and the second generation typifies our new man:
A. Paul’s intention in writing 1 Corinthians was to help the saints experience the dying out of the old man and the growing up of the new man—3:1 and footnote 11, 6-9; 5:7; 10:3-13.
B. The good land in 2 Corinthians typifies Christ Himself as the very embodiment of the processed Triune God given to us as the divine grace for our enjoyment—1:12; 4:15; 6:1; 8:1, 9; 9:8, 14; 12:9; 13:14.
C. We need to be those who grow in life into the full possession and enjoyment of the all- inclusive Christ, God’s promised land; to grow in life is to eliminate the old generation and to be renewed in our mind, emotion, and will for our transformation; transformation is the dying out of the old man and the growing up of the new man.
D. God’s economy is to have our old man (the outer man) consumed and our new man (the inner man) renewed day by day—4:16.
E. Transformation is the inward metabolic process in which God works to spread His divine life and nature throughout every part of our being, particularly our soul, bringing Christ and His riches into our being as our new element and causing our old, natural element to be gradually discharged—3:18; Rom. 12:2.
F. By the Lord’s mercy and grace, since we have come into the Lord’s recovery, a metabolic change is taking place within us; this is the experience of being renewed for our growth in life and transformation in life to usher us into the enjoyment of Christ as our good land for God’s building and kingdom.
